## About Dots

This program emulates a game of Left Center Right. "LCR, or Left Center Right, is a dice game for three or more players, published by George & Company LLC in 1992. It is entirely a game of chance. The players make no decisions of any kind, even as to wagering".[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCR_(dice_game))

## Gameplay

"Each player receives at least 3 chips. Players take it in turn to roll three six-sided dice, each of which is marked with "L", "C", "R" on one side, and a single dot on the three remaining sides. For each "L" or "R" thrown, the player must pass one chip to the player to his left or right, respectively. A "C" indicates a chip to the center (pot). A dot has no effect. If a player has fewer than three chips left, he is still in the game but his number of chips is the number of dice he rolls on his turn, rather than rolling all three. When a player has zero chips, he passes the dice on his turn, but may receive chips from others and take his next turn accordingly. The winner is the last player with chips left. He does not roll the dice, and wins the center pot. If he chooses to play another round, he does not roll 3, he keeps his pot and plays with that."[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCR_(dice_game)#Gameplay)
